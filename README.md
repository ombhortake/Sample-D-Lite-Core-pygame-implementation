Key Features

    Dynamic Obstacles: Click on the grid to place or remove obstacles.
    Path Recalculation: The path is recalculated every time an obstacle is toggled.
    Visual Feedback: The current path is highlighted in blue, while the start and goal nodes are green and red, respectively.

Controls

    Spacebar: Initiate pathfinding (though it automatically recalculates when toggling obstacles).
    Mouse Click: Click on a grid cell to toggle it as an obstacle or free space.

Notes

    This implementation dynamically adjusts the grid as you interact with it, demonstrating a simple version of D* Lite's capabilities.
    You can refine it further by implementing features like cost updates for dynamic environments, which can enhance efficiency during pathfinding.
